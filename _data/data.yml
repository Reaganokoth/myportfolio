career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      At the dawn of my career, I have developed different disciplines, from the
      technical to the social. With a heart open to our land's resource and land
      sustainability to the needs of the society, my desire is to make a positive impact
      with my growing global mind-set and cross-cultural appreciation. Besides my
      education, interest in Remote Sensing and Data Science, I am a creative and
      honest expressive communicator. I am tolerant, reliable, charismatic and able
      to address problems. It would be an honor to work with an organization that will
      have me contributing to something bigger than myself and positively impact the
      community.
education:
    - degree: MSc Applied Earth Observation and Geo-analysis of the Living Environment (EAGLE)
      university: Würzburg University Germany
      time: 2020 - Present
      details: |
        This master's program is in part based on the exploration of various
        programming languages to process and analyze Earth Observation data. During
        this study, I have implemented various projects that directly involved
        manipulation and processing of EO data using the most contemporary
        platforms. In the most recent project, I modelled drought induced loss in
        agricultural production in Kenya based on freely available satellite data
        (MODIS, CHIRPS). I was able to accurately predict major drought years in
        Kenya. This work was performed both on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and in R.
        On another project, I quantified drought impact on European Forests
        following the 2018 heatwave. Here I mapped dead trees from Planet Data
        using Python.
        
    - degree: MSc Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management (Oceans & Lakes)
      university: Vrije Universiteit Brussels | Ghent University | Antwerpen University
      time: 2018 - 2020
      details: |
        I had a year of research and development where I worked with Ph.D. students and my professor for my master's thesis. My work focused on finding patterns of dune resilience and stability in relation to tidal regimes, urbanization, and country. Here, I wrote codes to classify multiple satellite images from multiple timestamps into different landcover classes then extracted relevant vegetation data.
